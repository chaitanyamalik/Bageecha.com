This application is built using Angular and is inspired by SportsStore Application in [Pro-Angular 6 by Adam Freeman](https://www.academia.edu/38617677/Pro_Angular_6_-_2018-_Third_Edition)

While the basic structure of this application remains the same, I've added some new components and played around with the overall look and feel of the website.

Replace these files in your Angular project. You can create a new angular application by typing the following in your terminal.

`ng new {app-name}`

Caution: You will need to add some external modules to run this project. I'd advise you to take a look at the steps in the book if you are building this application.

After you've added these files to your project, We'll look how to run this project.
First, open a new terminal and type

`npm run json`

Then, open a new terminal (with the previous one left running) and type

`ng serve --port 3000 --open`

After the code is compiled, the website will open in a new tab automatically. If it doesn't, simply navigate to http://localhost:3000/

Have fun playing with the application ! The Admin credentials are Name:- `admin` Password:- `secret`
